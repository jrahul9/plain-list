# plain-list

# Intro
Plain List app based on ReactJS which list out products in a card view.

# Description
This is a task which i did recently, it is an app based out of ReactJS which renders product list and fetches data from an api which i have created using express. 

Flow: 
- When the app starts it generates a token using the token api and its valid for few hours.
- Using the token, products are fetched.

Have created two api's one to generate token and one to fetch products.
In Front End have created a page to render Plain List and created nescessary components required to render the list.

Points Focused:
- Good Codebase structure
- ES6

Tech Stack:
- FrontEnd: React, Redux-Saga, Material-UI
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js


*Api might not work, will add few mock api's to fetch data.
